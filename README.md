Playing with C and C++

This repo is to serve as backup for a bunch of old code going as far back as 2013.

Interesting things include:
- my very first game - a space shooter with Allegro 5
  * a version with primitive graphics in C++
  * a version with images in C

- my very first project ever - a CLI Tic-Tac-Toe game

- a sudoku solver in C++

- spritesheets, animations, scrolling backgrounds with Allegro 5

- data structures and algorithms, and problems related to them

- algorithmic problems
  * some very easy from the time I was just getting into programming
  * some a bit more challenging
  * the first 6 or so Project Euler problems

- toy programs for trying things out

- a tiny bit of SDL
